# Homework 5 Workday Scheduler

## Description

This code quiz was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and Moment.

When the user arrives on the application, the current hour will be highlighted in red. Hours in the past will be displayed in grey, and upcoming hours will be displayed in green.

When the user types something in the text area of a given hour and they click the save icon, the application will save the user's task.
